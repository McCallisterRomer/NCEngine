debug mode
    -display draw calls and tris/verts
    -fix camera controls
    -add separate camera
    -fix naming of user components in gui
    -main window/main menu dilemma


graphics resources
    -meshes are loaded from ObjLoader even if v/i buffers already exist(in Model constructor)
        -note: the 'shared' buffers are ultimately used, but file reading happens for each instance regardless
    -is it necessary for resources to be unloaded?


-rotations are still strange sometimes(also need world/local options)
-improve point light components and how they relate to entities
-fix window scaling so changes are made to Window, Graphics, and buffer sizes
-camera needs parameters for fov/clipping planes
-support for multiple cameras and lights
-additional light types (directional/spot)


Potentially Large Items
    -update physics to 3d
    -make (program?) for generating new user types quickly
    -save changes in debug mode
