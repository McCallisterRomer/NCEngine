IN PROGRESS
***********

-Matrix allocator
-try explicitly aligned matrices
-assimp loading

-update physics to 3d
    -layers apply to collisions
    -need trigger type?
    -optimize collisions
    -add physics body

***********
BUGS
***********
-Phong pixel shader roughness seems backwards
-ImGui::IsAnyWindowHovered() [Hud.cpp] is obsolete - change and fix error where clicking on ui returns
    false(no window hovered)
-Using Vector3::Zero for scale is invalid, does having and of x,y,z == 0 result in an invalid state?
-don't believe gfx resources are ever unloaded
- PBRMaterial.cpp GraphicsResource wont bind two consecutive same textures because the index won't increment if the first same resources has been added.


***********
TO ADD
***********
-#ifdef editor stuff is getting out of hand; restore sanity
-Mesh and Model may not need default ctors anymore - requires major changes to Prefab.cpp
-way to lock camera pitch to 180deg range
-threads
-particle systems!
-animation
-<source_location> added in gcc 11; when mingw gets it change from <experimental/source_location>
-GfxResMan should try to get rid of strings as keys
-profiling only works well on per frame stuff; it is hard to get meaningful data about physics w/o syncing fixed/frame rates
-add global search to api - GlobalGetComponent
-next vulkan PR: configure pipeline to have dynamic state for viewport and scissor rectangle so entire pipeline does not need to be recreated on swapchain resize. (Keeping code reviews "small" after second large vulkan code review)

LOW PRIORITY
-gtest must be dl'd manually
-display draw calls and tris/verts
-fix naming of user components in gui
-camera needs parameters for fov/clipping planes
-save changes in debug mode
