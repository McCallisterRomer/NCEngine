IN PROGRESS
***********

Mesh and Model may not need default ctors anymore - requires major changes to Prefab.cpp
assert that Transform scale is never 0 as it causes problems with the matrix(also scale of 0 doesn't make sense)
vectors
    double check operators (does Vector3::operator==() work?)
    need tests
    Vector4 needs cpp so DXMath isn't included in header

***********
BUGS
***********
-rotations are still strange sometimes(also need world/local options)
-don't believe gfx resources are ever unloaded
- PBRMaterial.cpp GraphicsResource wont bind two consecutive same textures because the index won't increment if the first same resources has been added.


***********
TO ADD
***********
-add global search to api - GlobalGetComponent
-update physics to 3d
-lights
    -improve point light components and how they relate to entities
    -support for multiple lights
    -additional light types (directional/spot)
-rendering improvements
    -way to mark things static so batching is possible
    -add frustrum and occlusion culling
-Figure out the best way to edit the material properties or properties of the technique in the editor

LOW PRIORITY
-gtest must be dl'd manually
-unused params are marked (void)param for now, many of these can be removed,
    but some are there for uniformity (ex: Aquire passes gfx* to resource constructor always)
-display draw calls and tris/verts
-fix naming of user components in gui
-main window/main menu dilemma
-camera needs parameters for fov/clipping planes
-save changes in debug mode
-all d3d "slots" are passed at uint literals, look into what exactly
    is needed here - can we use an enum for these so there is some 
    semantic meaning tied to the values passed?
