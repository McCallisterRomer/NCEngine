TO ADD
***********
-#ifdef editor stuff is getting out of hand; restore sanity
-next vulkan PR: configure pipeline to have dynamic state for viewport and scissor rectangle so entire pipeline does not need to be recreated on swapchain resize. (Keeping code reviews "small" after second large vulkan code review)
